# Critterpedia :bug: :tropical_fish: :shell:
React App using API data

## Project Description

For this project I created an Animal Crossing Critterpedia resource. The main page helps you search for what critters are available at a specific month. You can click on any critters you catch and they will be added to your caught library. You can also view all bugs, fish or diving critters on their own pages. Scroll through to see all of the things you have yet to catch and plan your strategy based on month.

#### MVP
- Find and use external api 
- Render all critter icons on pages separated by type (bugs, fish, diving) 
- Search dropdowns that filter results to type and month
- Clickable critter icons that add to library when caught
- Single critter info that pops up on the side of your search bar
- Caught library page that displays all your critters

#### PostMVP

- Add about me and landing page
- Add random critter of the day info
- Add a carousel of all critter info on pages separated by type (bugs, fish, diving) 
- Add a filter based on where the critters can be found
- Add further drop down searches based on price or how rare they are

## Code Snippet

```
//Getting my random critter of the day

const getCritter = () => {
    let critterArray = Object.keys(critterData);
    let randomCritter = Math.floor(Math.random() * critterArray.length);
    currentCritter = critterData[critterArray[randomCritter]];
    if (currentCritter !== undefined) {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>{currentCritter.name["name-USen"]}</h2>
          <img className="icon-random" src={currentCritter["icon_uri"]} alt="icon" />
          <h2>Catch Prase:</h2><p className="catch-phrase">{currentCritter["catch-phrase"]}</p>
        </div>
    );}
};
